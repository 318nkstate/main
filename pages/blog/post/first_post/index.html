    <h1>WHAT'S UP WORLD</h1>
<p>posted: 2021-04-12</p>
<p>The first post built locally on 11ty and then pushed into the website's git repo.</p>
<p>More stuff is to come soon, but the direction where this blog will go is a question up in the air.</p>
<p>For now this part of the website will be kept with as minimal styling as possible to counter balance <a href="/">the front page.</a></p>
<p>Sometimes their might be a typo that stops the readable flow of each post but please ignore them as they will be fixed... after the third edit.</p>
<p>There might be topics that might offend you. If you are offended by a cat eating its' own poop thinking that it is a rat well that's too bad.</p>
<p>All be it welcome to the blog. Where random thoughts collide and other stuff. While at the same time keeping it simple, because i'm dumb. |┐∵|┘</p>
<p><em>But don't mind that part.</em></p>
